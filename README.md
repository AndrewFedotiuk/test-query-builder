# Thinks to improve
Two areas for potential consideration: component memoization for performance optimization, and form libraries for enhanced validation. However, both are absolutely reasonable trade-offs for a test task, and the current solution works effectively within the given constraints.

The task was completed according to given criteria.

I'm very open to discussing these ideas further and welcome different viewpoints. Every project has unique considerations, and I'm always interested in understanding the reasoning behind technical decisions.
